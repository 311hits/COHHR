   	</ol>
	</li>

<li>EMPLOYEE AND SUPERVISORY OBLIGATIONS
	<ol>
   	<li>All employees � Employees who are subjected to conduct in violation of this policy are encouraged to report the conduct at the earliest possible stage, before the conduct becomes severe or pervasive, so that the City can take appropriate action to remedy the offensive conduct. A delay in reporting may impair the City�s ability to investigate or to take corrective action. Employees may report prohibited conduct to the Office of Inspector General (OIG), or the Designated Departmental Representatives (DDRs) assigned to their department. Employees may report sexual harassment also to the City of Houston�s Sexual Harassment Hotline.</li>
   	<li>All supervisors � Any supervisor or manager who receives a complaint of workplace or sexual harassment or other prohibited conduct or who observes prohibited conduct in his or her department shall take prompt and appropriate action reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with this policy. At a minimum, the supervisor or manager shall as expeditiously as possible make a report to a Designated Department Representative assigned to his or her department. No supervisor or manager has authority to agree not to transmit a report or to agree to a delay in transmitting a report. Failure of a supervisor or manager to discharge responsibilities under this paragraph is a violation of this policy and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination or indefinite suspension. Supervisors and managers are prohibited from having sexual relationships with subordinates.</li>
	<li>All department directors � Directors shall implement this policy by:
		<ol>
		<li>Rigorously enforcing the standards imposed by this policy;</li>
		<li>Developing and disseminating appropriate departmental procedures that communicate to employees that violations of this policy will not be tolerated and will result in corrective action, up to and including termination or indefinite suspension;</li>
		<li>Taking appropriate action to ensure that complaints are promptly and fairly investigated;</li>
		<li>Imposing corrective action, up to and including termination or indefinite suspension, when violations of this policy are confirmed; and</li>
		<li>Ensuring that employees receive periodic training regarding this policy.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
<li>COMPLAINT PROCESS
	<ol>
	<li>When an employee believes that he or she has been subjected to conduct prohibited by this policy, the individual is encouraged to inform the alleged offender that the conduct in question is unwelcome or offensive. If this approach is unsuccessful or not feasible, the individual may pursue informal means of resolution.</li>
   	<li>Advice and Information � Any individual may seek advice or information on matters related to this policy without having to lodge a formal complaint. Employees may call the City�s Sexual Harassment Hotline (713-837-9030) or contact the Designated Department Representatives (DDRs) assigned to the employee�s Department, or contact the Employee Relations Section of the Human Resources Department.</li>
   	<li>Informal Resolution � Requests for informal resolution may be addressed to a Designated Departmental Representative or to the Employee Relations Section of the Human Resources Department. Each department director shall appoint at least two DDRs who are qualified by training to serve the functions of this policy. Whenever possible, the DDRs should consist of at least one male and one female. Departments that are small or that lack qualified personnel to serve as DDRs may designate one or more DDRs who are assigned to the Human Resources Department. The identity of the DDRs shall be appropriately publicized to employees. DDRs shall maintain a written record of the terms and conditions of the informal resolution.</li>
	<li>Formal Complaints � A formal complaint may be filed by the employee who has been subjected to the prohibited conduct, by an employee who has observed prohibited conduct, or by a Designated Departmental Representative. The formal complaint process may be used whether the complainant or the accused is a City employee, supervisor, manager, independent contractor, employee of a vendor or contractor, or other third party. Use of the informal resolution process is not a prerequisite to filing a formal complaint. Formal complaints may be presented to any of the following offices:
		<ol>
		<li>Office of the Inspector General (OIG) - (832) 394-5100, located on the fourth floor of 900 Bagby Street, Houston, Texas; OR</li>
		<li>Employee�s	Designated	Departmental	Representative	(contact	information ordinarily will be available on Departmental bulletin boards); OR</li>
		<li>City of Houston Sexual Harassment Hotline (operated by the Organizational Development and Employee/Labor Relations Office) - (713) 837-9030.</li>
		</ol>
	
<p>All complaints received by a DDR or the Sexual Harassment Hotline will be transmitted to the OIG for processing. Employees who initially submit oral complaints will be required to place their complaints in writing.
Employees who are found to have violated this policy shall be subject to corrective action and/or discipline, up to and including termination or indefinite suspension.  The department director shall implement disciplinary or corrective action without  delay, and the measures taken shall be reasonably calculated to prevent future violations of this policy. If the department director is the subject of the complaint, the report and remedial action will be determined by the Mayor or his or her designee.
In the event that an employee files a complaint against a DDR or other employee who has responsibilities under this policy, or in the event that such employee is a material fact witness in any investigation, the OIG may modify its procedures to ensure that such employee is not involved in the processing of the complaint.</p>
</li>
