Civil Infractions - Any act committed in connection with the operation of a vehicle that constitutes a hazard to traffic and is prohibited by federal, state, or City ordinance, such as City of Houston Code of Ordinances - Chapter 26, Articles II - VI, "Parking," and results in a fine that does not appear on a Driver's state driving record.
<br><br>
Controlled Substance - A substance as defined in Texas Health & Safety Code Ann. §481.001 et seq. (Vernon 2003) as amended.
<br><br>
Conviction(s) - A conviction occurs when a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final judgment adjudicating guilt after a plea of "guilty" or "nolo contendere" or upon a verdict of guilty and assesses any punishment, including probation or deferred adjudication. The payment of a fine assessed by a court of competent jurisdiction for a moving violation is a conviction.
<br><br>
Course and Scope - Performing one's assigned duties in furtherance of the City's interests as defined in Title 5, Subtitle A, Chapter 401, Subchapter B, Section 401.011(12) of the Texas Labor Code.
<br><br>
Departmental Motor Vehicle Crash/Disqualification Review Panel - A three- to five-member department panel consisting of a cross-section of employees who review the department's determination of causation of a crash or disqualification of an employee's driving privileges.
<br><br>
Driver - An employee who operates a City Vehicle or a privately owned vehicle on City business.
<br><br>
Emergency Home Storage - A vehicle assigned for home storage during inclement weather conditions to cover emergency situations over a period of up to 2 days, or over the full duration of a disaster as declared by the Mayor.
<br><br>
Employee - All individuals engaged in the performance of duties for or on behalf of the City whether hired, appointed, elected, full or part time, temporary, or grant-funded without limitations as to municipal or classified service. This category includes temporary employees working for temporary agencies, City Hall fellows, and interns.
<br><br>
Essential Function - A duty that the employee holding a City position must be able to perform as a function of that position. For purposes of this A.P., a function is considered essential if (1) the employee spends significant time performing the function or (2) although the function may account for only a relatively small amount of time, or is to be performed infrequently, it must be accomplished to meet department needs.
<br><br>
Idle - The operation of an engine in the operating mode where the engine is not engaged in gear, where the engine operates at a speed at the revolutions per minute specified by the engine or vehicle manufacturer for when the accelerator is fully released, and there is no load on the engine.
<br><br>
Incident - A collision between two or more vehicles; or between a City vehicle and a person; or between an object and City vehicle that results in cumulative property damage or estimated aggregate damages of less than one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars but no personal injury to anyone. This includes events where there is a collision or involves no more than a City vehicle itself with no apparent or visible damage, and where there is damage to public/private property but the property owner does not file a claim.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Moving Violation - Any act committed in Texas or out of state, in connection with the operation of a vehicle which constitutes a hazard to traffic and is prohibited by federal, state or local City ordinance and results in a conviction. This term does not include convictions for status offenses such as the operation of a vehicle without evidence of vehicle registration or a current vehicle inspection sticker, immediate possession of a valid driver's license (assumes the employee has one, but was not in his/her possession at the time), nor does it apply to vehicle defects or citations for parking violations. Citations issued for not having proof of financial responsibility of a privately owned vehicle will not be used for disqualification purposes unless the vehicle is driven on City business and the employee fails (after reasonable time and/or opportunity) or refuses to obtain insurance. Citations for failure to have insurance may be dismissed upon presentation of proof of financial responsibility; consequently, if an employee fails or refuses to obtain coverage, the conviction may be used to disqualify the employee from driving.
<br><br>
Multiple Moving Violations - When two or more moving violations and/or one or more moving violation and a motor vehicle crash arise out of the same event or occurrence, they shall be considered together as a single event for purposes of application of this A.P.

</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		<li>Consequences of Disqualification
			<ol>

				<ol>
				<li>The employee must continue to perform all the essential functions of his/her job; none of them may be modified or removed because the employee is prohibited from driving; and</li>
				<li>No one has authority to permanently authorize the use  of or modify the essential functions of another employee to chauffeur the disqualified employee in the performance of his/her duties. The department director has the authority to authorize a one-time exemption for a limited period of time.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			<li>If driving is an essential function of the position, and if an employee is disqualified from driving and the department director decides not to indefinitely suspend the employee, he/she may grant the employee a resolution period from the date the employee is disqualified to independently find another non-driving position within the City. During this resolution period the following shall apply:
				<ol>
				<li>Since the employee is disqualified and prohibited from driving, the employee shall not be allowed to continue to drive on City business in any capacity.
					<ol>
					<li>The disqualified employee may be assigned other non-driving duties to perform, as needed, for the benefit of the department. These other assigned tasks and duties may not be grieved during this period for any reason including work outside the employee's classification and may not serve as a basis for a less than effective employee Performance Evaluation.</li>
					<li>This provision does not prohibit the disqualified employee from riding occasionally as a passenger if the employee and the disqualified employee are both traveling to the same location in the regular performance of the qualified driving employee's assigned duties. This provision prohibiting chauffeuring does not apply to a disqualified supervisor, if disqualification would result in one or more work crews being unsupervised in the field. This limited exception allowing chauffeuring may be used only during the specified resolution period.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				<li>A disqualified employee has no right and is not entitled to a modification of essential job functions, or an accommodation such as a driver. Neither the City nor the department is required to find another position or create a new position to accommodate an employee who has been disqualified from driving on City business.</li>
				<li>During any resolution period granted, the disqualified employee may appeal the disqualification or cause finding of a motor vehicle crash within 10 days of the receipt of the Form 1, Notice of Disqualification to the Departmental Motor Vehicle Crash/ Review Panel and then the  City Motor Vehicle Crash/Disqualification Review Committee, and/or find another position within the City. Participation in the appeal process does not extend or abate the specified resolution period of the disqualified employee's employment status with the City, even if one or both appeals are not completed. Both processes may proceed concurrently.</li>
				<li>The disqualified employee may apply for a vacant or posted position anywhere in the City, including the employees own department, for a nondriving position for which the employee qualifies.
					<ol>
					<li>The employee shall be given reasonable opportunity during regular City business hours to seek, apply for and/or interview for another position with the City. Reasonable opportunity shall not exceed two hours on any given City business day and only if the employee regularly works the day shift, Monday through Friday. No City time shall be given if the employee is not regularly working during City business hours. No overtime shall be authorized to allow afternoon or evening shift employees to apply. Verification of attendance off-site may be requested to confirm compliance with this provision.</li>
					<li>The employee may apply and, if all criteria are met, the disqualified employee may be referred (without preference) for possible selection to any posted position.</li>
					<li>If the employee qualifies and is selected for the posted position, the employee may, if applicable, seek a voluntary reclassification, transfer, or demotion.</li>
					<li>Neither the City nor the employee's department is required to provide training or any other upgrade or enhancement of the employee's skills. The employee is solely responsible for requesting and obtaining all training, licenses, or other requirements needed to qualify for another position.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			<li>If, after the resolution period has ended, the employee's status is not resolved:
				<ol>
				<li>If the employee qualifies for a vacant nondriving position within the department, but elects not to take the position, the department director (at his/her sole discretion) may involuntarily reclassify, transfer, or demote the disqualified employee to the nondriving position. If the employee later becomes qualified again for the driving position, he/she would have to apply and compete on an equal basis for the position with other applicants.</li>
				<li>The employee may voluntarily resign his/her position and apply in the future for his/her former or another driving position without preference once the employee is in compliance with this A.P. and becomes qualified to drive on City business.</li>
				<li>The employee may voluntarily resign his/her position and apply for another nondriving position that may be posted at any time in the future for which the employee is qualified; or, if none of the above are elected;</li>
				<li>The department director may request that the Civil Service Commission involuntarily remove the employee from his/her position without prejudice to the employee's right to apply without preferential referral for his/her former or another driving position after he/she qualifies to drive in the future or for any other position in the City for which he/she may qualify.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			<li>Driving privileges removed pursuant to this section are not subject to restoration by any outside action, including the granting of an occupational license.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
