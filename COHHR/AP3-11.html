   	</ol>
	</li>
<li>DEFINITIONS</li>
<br><br>
Absence - Time away from work during what would be considered an employee's scheduled work hours. An employee's absence may be the result of an employee benefit, a specific goal with supervisors consent, or unauthorized.<br><br>
Salary - The regular rate of base pay plus longevity, but exclusive of other allowances, incentives, differentials or other compensation ordinarily received by the employee.<br><br>


<li>POLICY
	<ol>
	<li>Employees are expected to report for work whenever scheduled. Employees who for any reason will be delayed in reporting for work are required to notify their supervisor promptly by a direct telephone call. Other forms of notification, including but not limited to text messages, emails, do not comply with this policy without expressed written approval from management or department policy. A telephone call from someone other than the employee does not comply with this policy, except in emergency situations, excluding incarceration. Supervisors shall identify another supervisor to call in the event of an absence or unavailability.</li>
   	<li>Employees should notify their supervisor in advance whenever they are unable to report to work for any reason. As much advance notice as possible should be given. If the supervisor is not available, the employee should contact another management member of the department and then make attempts later to contact the immediate supervisor. Department policy may amend these protocols based on business needs as approved by the director. If an employee is unable to report to work without advance notice, the employee must comply with the notice requirements set forth in 6.1.</li>
	<li>A failure to notify the immediate supervisor of any anticipated absence or delay in reporting for work can result in loss of compensation during the absence and may be grounds for disciplinary action up to and including indefinite suspension or termination. Supervisors should be aware of these behavior patterns as they develop and  should make every effort to discover the reason and to assist the employee in correcting the problem. It shall be the responsibility of the immediate supervisor to document any such tendencies and to produce such documentation should disciplinary action be required as a result.</li>
	<li>Employees may be compensated during authorized absences. Absences in excess of the amount of the employee's accrued leave by an employee will not be compensated, but will not necessarily jeopardize the employee's employment status.</li>
   	<li>Employees shall not be required nor permitted to work any period of time beyond the normal starting or quitting times for the purpose of making up lost time unless it is otherwise specified in this policy or authorized by the department director or designee.</li>
	<li>Employees who are absent from work for three (3) consecutive work days without good cause and without giving proper notice to their immediate supervisor shall be considered to have resigned from the employment of the City.</li>

	<li>Meal Breaks
		<ol>
		<li>Each full-time employee may be allowed a meal break from thirty (30) to sixty
(60) minutes near the middle of the workday, and each part-time employee shall be allowed a meal break of the same duration before five (5) consecutive hours are worked. Exceptions to address matters of public safety and health are subject to approval by the department director.</li>
		<li>Employees shall not be compensated during their meal breaks and shall adhere to whatever sign out/sign in policy is in effect within a given department. The duration and time of employee meal breaks shall be determined by each supervisor with appropriate regard for the work load. In either case, the employee shall be expected to work a full work day.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	<li>Rest Breaks
		<ol>
		<li>Each employee may receive a rest break of fifteen (15) minutes at approximately the middle of every four (4) hours of work not broken by a meal break as permitted by work requirements. Time spent on rest breaks will be compensated, but employees should still follow the department's sign out/sign in policy where such policy is in effect. The time and availability for employee rest breaks shall be determined and scheduled by each supervisor with appropriate regard for the work requirements.</li>
		<li>Those employees choosing to remain at their work station during rest breaks will not be entitled to leave before the end of a scheduled shift.</li>
		<li>An employee's supervisor may require that an employee remain in the immediate work area during a rest break. When this requirement is not in place, employees are discouraged from leaving the immediate work area.</li>
		<li>Rest breaks shall not be used in conjunction with a meal break or a shift start or end.</li>
		
		</ol>
The department director can alter or amend meal or rest break schedules as necessary to ensure proper operational functioning of a department or any division or area therein.
		</li>
	<li>Holidays
		<ol>
		<li>If an employee's regularly scheduled day off occurs on a holiday and the employee does not work, the employee is paid at 1.0 times his/her regular rate of pay for his/her scheduled hours.</li>
		<li>If an employee’s regularly scheduled day off'occurs on a holiday and the employee is not called into work, the employee may be given, at the department director’s discretion, another day off in lieu of the holiday or can be paid  at straight time for the number of hours normally worked. If given another day off in lieu of the holiday, the holiday must be used within 180 days or the day will be paid out.</li>
		<li>If an employee works on a holiday, the employee shall be (1) paid at 1.0 times his/her regular rate of pay for hours worked plus be given an alternate paid day off to be used within 180 days (or the day will be paid out) or (2) the employee shall be paid at 2.0 times his/her regular rate of pay for hours worked. If the employee is scheduled to work on short notice (less than 24 hours),  the employee will be paid/accrue an additional .5 times for hours worked on the holiday. The method used shall be at the discretion of the department director.</li>

		<li>The floating holiday must be taken on a date mutually acceptable to  the employee and management with at least seven days advance notice. This timeline may be increased or decreased by department policy.</li>
		<li>The floating holiday not taken within the calendar year will not accrue. If the floating holiday is not taken for reasons within the employee's control, it shall be lost and neither compensatory time nor pay in lieu of a holiday will be created.</li>
		<li>If an employee is required to work or is called in to work on a day previously arranged and approved as a floating holiday, the employee will be given the opportunity to re-schedule the holiday.</li>
		<li>Employees hired on or after July 1st of any given calendar year will not be eligible to take a floating holiday for that year.</li>

		<li>Subpoenas, summons, or other such court ordered appearances shall be treated and compensated in the same manner as jury duty only when such an appearance is related, directly or indirectly to City business or to the employee's role as a City employee. The employee shall otherwise be held accountable for any and all court time absence(s) not so related.</li>
		<li>Similar restrictions of being related to City business shall apply when an employee is called upon to offer testimony, to act as a witness, to  give deposition, to attend consultations or interrogations, or to otherwise appear before a board, commission, or agency, committee or subcommittee, or other official body of the city, state, or federal government.</li>

		<li>Where such convention attendance conflicts with an employee's work hours and necessitates the employee taking time off, the supervisor, with  appropriate notice, shall make allowances as required to accommodate the employee's attendance privilege. Such time off, however, shall not be paid and shall be regarded as an excused leave of absence without pay unless otherwise charged against an employee's earned benefit such as vacation time, a floating holiday, accumulated overtime, etc., exclusive of sick leave.</li>

		</li>

	<li>Participation in Community/Civic Affairs

However, time spent in work for charitable, public, or similar purposes at the request of the City or under its direction or control shall be considered hours worked for pay purposes. Voluntary employee participation in community affairs that may involve an extended period of time away from work shall be handled at the discretion of the department director.</li>
		<li>Employees are encouraged to accept invitations to speak before civic groups and to contribute articles to professional or trade publications.
