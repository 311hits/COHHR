  <li>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES</li>
To provide a safe and healthful workplace for City of Houston employees and to reduce work related injury and illness frequency and severity.
  <li>DEFINITIONS</li>

<br>
Accident Prevention Plan (APP) – A series of safety initiatives developed by each department from nationally recognized standards of best practice, such as, but are not limited to, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Safety Council (NSC), National Institute for Occupational Health (NIOSH), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), or Centers for Disease Control (CDC).<br>

Accident – Any event that generates a medical or indemnity cost regardless of the compensability of the claim to include Motor Vehicle Crash. Property damage may be considered a result of an accident.<br>

Catastrophic Event – When one or more of the following conditions occurs: fatality; amputation; head injury; heart attack; serious electrical shock; multiple fractures; serious burns; stroke; spinal injury; potential media attention; or motor vehicle accidents involving three or more city vehicles.<br>

Department Safety Staff or HR Safety Liaison – Department safety personnel or those who have been assigned safety functions.<br>

Employee – Any individual employed directly by the City of Houston or a contractor (temporary employee) directly supervised by the City of Houston engaged in the performance of duties for or on behalf of the City.<br>

HR Risk Management – The division of HR with oversight responsibilities for City Accident prevention services, workers’ compensation administration and compliance with safety related policies, procedures, ordinances and statutes.<br>

Incident – 1) Any event that results in an injury, exposure or illness, regardless of the severity, or damage to property or equipment; or 2) a collision between two or more vehicles; or between a City vehicle and a person; or between an object and City vehicle that results in any type of property damage. This includes events where there is a collision or involves a City vehicle with no apparent or visible damage, and where there is damage to public/private property but the property owner does not file a claim.<br>

Motor Vehicle Crash – 1) A collision between two or more vehicles; or 2) between a vehicle and a person or an object; or 3) a vehicle rollover; or 4) a vehicle causing personal injury to anyone or any damage to public/private property; or damage to City property.<br>

Near-Miss – Any unplanned event that did not result in injury, illness, or damage, but had the potential to do so given a different set of circumstances. Only a fortunate break in the chain of events prevented an injury, fatality or damage; in other words, a miss that was nonetheless very near.<br>

Repeater – An Employee who has had three or more work related injuries/accidents in five years.<br>

<li>STANDARDS OF BEST PRACTICE
	<ol>
	<li>Safety personnel of the City are expected to use best practices and safety guidelines including OSHA regulations as minimal guidance in developing the various safety programs that are reasonably necessary for their departmental operations and associated risks. Guidance for use of policies means that the Safety Personnel will follow the standards provided in the most current OSHA regulations (and other appropriate regulations). Any exceptions to these standards, except those standards that conflict with currently accepted officer safety and police training and practices, shall require the written approval of the Director of Human Resources Department (HR). No exceptions shall be permitted except without such written approval. In addition and as a supplement, safety personnel are expected to use available national standards, such as American National Standards Institute (ANSI), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), National Electric Code (NEC), the American Water Works Association, the Chlorine Institute, or the Compressed Gas Association, to develop safety programs. When no regulations or standards exist, safety personnel are encouraged to review comparable industry best practices to develop safety programs.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li>ENFORCEMENT
	<ol>
	<li>HR Safety Division is charged with supporting, monitoring and ensuring that departments create and maintain effective APPs with associated DSC plans and programs aimed at preventing workplace injuries. If department plans or programs are found to be ineffective through objective audits, reviews or assessments with credible supporting documentation the department director, HR Director and SE-RM shall be notified by the safety officer conducting the audits. Included in the notice will be recommendations to the department director for improvement of the safety program with a goal of helping to create a safer workplace and further reducing injury and illness in the workplace. Following the audits, HR Risk Management may take a more active role within the department’s  safety program to ensure improvements are instituted to correct the areas found to be ineffective. The HR Safety Liaison shall then conduct appropriate reviews to ensure the changes have been successful and shall report the results to the HR Director.</li>
