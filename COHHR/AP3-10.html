	<li>POLICY
	<ol>
	<li>Employees may not accept or undertake outside employment activities, unless authorized by their department director.</li>
   	<li>This Administrative Procedure should not be construed as encouragement of outside employment by City employees.</li>
	<li>Employee rights must be balanced against the City’s need for maximum productivity during working hours and for employee loyalty.</li>
   	</ol>
	</li>
<li>PROCEDURE
	<ol>
	<li>Employees requesting permission to engage in outside employment shall submit Form CS75 (Attachment A, Form CS75) to their department director and any other individual whose signature is requested on the form.</li>
	<li>The request shall state the name and address of the outside employer, the nature of the job, and the hours of employment.</li>
	<li>The department director shall approve or deny the employee’s request and furnish a written copy of the determination to the employee (Attachment A, Form CS75).</li>
	<li>In considering requests to allow outside employment, department directors shall  be guided by the following:
		<ol>
		<li>Whether the outside employment will lessen the employee’s efficiency in any way in working for the City; and</li>
		<li>Whether the outside employment will place the employee in a conflict of interest with the City.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>The employee’s primary occupation and responsibility is his or her current position with the City.
		<ol>
		<li>Outside employment will not be considered an excuse for poor job performance, absenteeism, tardiness, or refusal to work overtime.</li>
		<li>Should the outside employment cause or contribute to any of these situations, it must be discontinued or the employee may be subject to disciplinary action.</li>
		</ol>
	<li>Employees who have accepted outside employment are not eligible for paid sick leave absence when the absence is the result of illness or injury related to outside employment.</li>
	<li>At the discretion of the department director, an employee who has been injured while actively engaged in outside employment may lose the privilege of being allowed to engage in a second job.</li>
	<li>Under no circumstances will a department director approve a request permitting a member of the department to hold an additional full-time or part-time position with the City that would deprive another person from regular employment.</li>
	<li>The director will be required to maintain a permanent record of all outside employment requests that have been authorized or denied.</li>
	<li>Policy exceptions and/or violations shall be brought to the attention of the Human Resources Director for review and recommended action.</li>
