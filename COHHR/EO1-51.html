The purpose of this Executive Order is to minimize disruptions to the workplace by solicitors and those seeking access to City employees engaged in the performance of their job duties.</li>
	<li>The primary purpose of all City facilities is to provide a safe and structured workplace for City employees to perform their core job duties relative to the administration of City business.
