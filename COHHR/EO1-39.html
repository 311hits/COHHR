<li>ALLEGATIONS RE: WHISTLEBLOWER ACT
	<ol>
	<li>A City employee or a former City employee who believes that the City has taken an adverse personnel action against her or him in violation of Chapter 554 of the Texas Government Code ("Whistleblower Act") may file a complaint ("Whistleblower Complaint") with the OIG stating the facts or circumstances giving rise to the employee's belief. A Whistleblower Complaint filed with the OIG should be in writing, on a form promulgated by the OIG.
		<ol>
		<li>Immediately upon receipt of a Whistleblower Complaint, the OIG will mark the date and time of receipt on the face of the Complaint.</li>
		<li>A Whistleblower Complaint should be filed with the OIG as promptly as possible but in any event within 90 days after the date on which the adverse personnel action occurred or was discovered through reasonable diligence.</li>
		<li>Except as authorized in writing by the City Attorney, the OIG must complete its investigation of a Whistleblower Complaint within 45 days after the date on which the Whistleblower Complaint was filed with the OIG.</li>
		<li>Promptly upon completion of its investigation of a Whistleblower Complaint, the OIG will deliver a written report of the OIG's findings and conclusions ("OIG's Report") to the director of the department in which the employee is or was most recently employed. The said director will issue a written disposition of the Whistleblower Complaint within 20 days after the date on which the Director received the OIG's Report.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	<li>If a civil-service-protected City employee timely files with the Commission an appeal ("Civil Service Appeal") of the employee's indefinite suspension, involuntary demotion, reduction in pay, or temporary suspension in excess of 15 days, and if the Civil Service Appeal alleges any fact or circumstance that may constitute a violation of the Whistleblower Act, the Commission immediately shall file a copy of the Civil Service Appeal with the OIG.
		<ol>
		<li>Immediately upon receipt of a Civil Service Appeal, the OIG will mark the date and time of receipt on the face of the Civil Service Appeal.</li>
		<li>The OIG will investigate only those facts and circumstances alleged in the Civil Service Appeal that may constitute violations of the Whistleblower Act.</li>
		<li>The OIG must complete its investigation of a Civil Service Appeal within 20 days after the date on which the Civil Service Appeal was filed with the OIG.</li>
		<li>Promptly upon completion of its investigation of a Civil Service Appeal, the OIG will deliver a written report of the OIG's findings and conclusions to the Commission, and the Commission will issue a written disposition of the Civil Service Appeal within 30 days after the date on which the Civil Service Appeal was filed with the Commission.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	<li>Other than Civil Service Appeals, which are addressed by Subsection 6.2 of  this Executive Order, the Commission may refer any Whistleblower Complaint to the OIG for investigation, which referral will constitute a "filing" with the OIG for the purposes of Subsections 6.1.3 and 6.1.4 of this Executive Order.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>


<li>POLICY CONFLICT
	<ol>
