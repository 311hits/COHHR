	</li>

</li>
<li>PROCEDURES
	<ol>
	<li>The following process is recommended to accomplish the HEAR program objectives:
		<ol>
		<li>At the beginning of the performance review process:
			<ol>
			<li>The department and/or divisions should establish annual strategic goals, objectives and core values that can be translated into SMART goals/objectives and behavioral factors for each employee.</li>
			<li>On the employee’s HEAR form, his/her goals/objectives and behavioral factors should be aligned with:
•	the department’s and/or division’s strategic goals/objectives and core values; and
•	the supervisor’s goals/objectives.</li>
			<li>The supervisor and employee should discuss the SMART goals/objectives and behavioral factors with the intent to reach a mutual agreement. However, if a mutual agreement is not reached, the supervisor has the final determination on the SMART goals/objectives and behavioral factors to be included on the HEAR form.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		
		<li>Throughout the performance review period, the supervisor will:
			<ol>
			<li>Provide continuous feedback, including quarterly or at least semi- annual reviews, on performance.</li>
			<li>Review the HEAR form with the employee for any modifications to goals/objectives or behavioral factors.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		<li>At the end of the performance review period:
			<ol>
			<li>The employee provides input on his/her achievements.</li>
			<li>The supervisor completes the performance assessment and submits it to his/her manager for review.</li>
			<li>The supervisor discusses the performance assessment with the employee and recommends development and growth opportunities.
				<ol>
				<li>If any changes to ratings on the performance assessment occur during this discussion, the supervisor should submit the revised performance assessment to his/her manager for review.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			
			<li>The performance assessment is finalized by signatures of the employee, supervisor and manager.</li>
				<ol>
				<li>A signature by an employee does not indicate an agreement with the rating given to the employee, but simply indicates that the employee has received the performance assessment.</li>
				<li>Should an employee refuse to sign, the supervisor shall write “Employee refuses to sign” and sign his/her name to the document along with the date and his/her employee number.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	<li>The performance assessments are to be given to the employees on a regularly scheduled basis to ensure consistency across departments:
		<ol>
		<li>Performance assessments should be conducted during the fifth (5th) and the eleventh (11th) month of a new hire’s probationary period, and then annually thereafter.</li>
		<li>For promotions with a change in pay grade, a five (5) month assessment should be conducted.</li>
		<li>For all municipal employees, annual assessments are to be conducted in April (non-supervisors) and May (supervisors and managers).</li>
		<li>Performance assessment schedules may change at the discretion of the Mayor.</li>
		<li>Department directors have the authority to increase the frequency of an employee’s performance assessment, for reasons such as the restructuring of the department or a division, or to document extraordinary or unacceptable performance.</li>
		<li>Employees with an overall performance rating of “below expectations” shall be reassessed within 120 days or at the discretion of the director. A civil service employee has the right to appeal an overall assessment rating of 2.99 or less through the City’s grievance process.</li>
		<li>Any employee with two consecutive assessment ratings of “below expectations” may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination or indefinite suspension. This applies even if the employee has not had any prior disciplinary actions performed against him/her.</li>
